# Spotify Clone - Web Player: Music for everyone

This is a Spotify clone app built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It aims to replicate some of the core features and user interface of the original Spotify music streaming service. This project was designed to showcase my skills in front-end web development.It is a responsive and user-friendly web application that allows users to play music.

## Technologies Used

* HTML5
* CSS3
* JavaScript
* Google Fonts (for custom typography)
* Font Awesome (for icons)

## Features

* Play/Pause: It allows the user to play or pause the currently selected track in the playlist.
* Next/Previous: It enables the user to skip to the next or previous track in the playlist.
* Seek: It allows the user to manually move forward or backward within a track by dragging a slider or clicking on a progress bar.
* Duration: It provides users with information about both the current duration and the total duration of the currently selected track. When the user hovers over the progress bar, it displays the duration of the track, allowing the user to jump to specific points within the track.
